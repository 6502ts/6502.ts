;;   This is the source for the stub BIOS used in supercharger emulation. It is
;;   a heavily modified version of the BIOS included in Stella, which in turn
;;   is based on code developed by Eckard Stolberg.
;;   ==========================================================================
;;   Interface:
;;
;;   * The BIOS code should be relocated to the beginning of the ROM bank
;;   * The entry vector ($F807) must be patched into the last four bytes of the
;;     ROM bank
;;   * A canary value of zero must be placed at $FFFB
;;   * The BIOS triggers the actual load by writing the requested multiload ID
;;     $FFF9. The write originates from page zero.
;;   * After loading, the following values must be patched into the ROM:
;;       - $FFF0: control word
;;       - $FFF1: a random value for A
;;       - $FFF2 -- $FFF3: entry point
