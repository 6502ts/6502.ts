# What is it?

6502.ts strives to be a collection of emulators for 6502 based systems written in Typescript.
It currently provides

 * A cycle-exact [CPU emulator](doc/cpu.md) and a generic [debugging environment](doc/vanilla_debugger.md)
   any attached hardware.
 * A minimal [hardware monitor](doc/ehbasic_monitor.md) for executing the
   [EhBasic interpreter](https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/asm/ehbasic)
   and Klaus Dormann's
   [6502 testsuite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
 * A full-featured [Atari 2600 emulator](doc/internals/stella.md), including sound, CRT phosphor simulation,
   debugging environment and a more user oriented ["stellerator" frontend](doc/stellerator.md).

The projects targets both NodeJS and the browser as runtime environments (no video or audio on node,
of course).

# Atari 2600 emulation

6502.ts implements a full-fledged emulator for the Atari 2600 VCS. Apart from the
debugger, there are two ways to use the emulator

 * **Stellerator** allows to import, manage and play VCS ROMs in the browser. ROMs are
   stored locally in the browser. It is responsive and can be used offline as a homescreen
   application on iOS. Stellerator is hosted on [github.io](https://6502ts.github.io/stellerator-ng).
 * **Stellerator (legacy)** is the old version of Stellerator. It is not developed anymore, but
   still hosted on [github.io](https://6502ts.github.io/stellerator).
 * **Stellerator embedded** offers a rich API to embed VCS emulation into web sites
   and web applications. Please check out the
   [documentation](https://6502ts.github.io/typedoc/stellerator-embedded/)
   for more information.

# Tooling

The emulation core is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
The Stellerator frontend is mostly written in the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and uses
a custom DOS-style CSS theme written in [SASS](https://sass-lang.com). Builds are
created with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
is used for package management.

# Building and development

6502.ts uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for package management, so you'll
have to install it first. After checking out the repos, do

```
    yarn install
```

to pull in the required packages.

## Tests

Test are run with

```
    yarn test
```

## Stellerator

The Stellerator frontend is built by doing

```
    yarn build
```

After the build has finished, the compiled frontend can be found in the `dist` directory.

For development, a dev server on http://localhost:6502 in watch mode can be fired up with

```
    yarn serve
```

Development builds are written to `dist-dev`. For these builds, Elm runs in development mode,
the compiled code is unminified, and the service worker registration is skipped.


## CLI

Several tools are available as CLI only (notably the ehBasic hardware monitor). Those can be
built by doing

```
    yarn tsc
```

After building, the compiled (modularized) code is available in the `compiled` directory,
and the tools are availabe in `compiled/bin`.

# NPM package

The core parts of the emulator are available as `6502.ts` on
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com).
The package includes TypeScript typings and can be used directly in TypeScript projects.

Most APIs are pretty stable by now, but not documented yet, with the exception
of Stellerator embedded. Please check out the
[documentation](https://6502ts.github.io/typedoc/stellerator-embedded/)
of Stellerator embedded for more details.

## Third party code

These license conditions do not apply to the contents of the `aux` directory which
mostly were written by folks other than me. Specifically:

 * `ehBasic` was taken from Jeff Tranters repository
   [here](https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/asm/ehbasic)
 * Klaus Dormann's 6502 testsuite (found in `aux/6502_suite`) was taken from his
   repository on github [here](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
   and is licensed under the GPL.
 * The `red_line` sample was taken from Kirk Israel's 2600 programming tutorial on
   [AtariAge](http://www.atariage.com/2600/programming/2600_101/03first.html). The
   `line_test` is a modified version of this code.
 * The `playfield_1` sample was taken from Kirk Israel's [2600 cookbook](http://alienbill.com/2600/cookbook/playfield.html).
 * `playfield_2` was taken from Andrew Davie's 2600 programming excercises on
   [AtariAge](http://atariage.com/forums/topic/28219-session-15-playfield-continued/).
 * The `macro.h` and `vcs.h` headers can be found free-floating on the internet
 * `flapping` is a homebrew game written by Kirk Israel available
   [here](http://alienbill.com/2600/flapping/).

2600 cartridge type detection code (and some of the more exotic cartridge types)
were modelled after the excellent [Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io)
emulator. Initial 2600 audio code was contributed by Martin Schr√∂der. ARM
support in DPC+ is powered by David Welch's
[thumbulator](https://github.com/dwelch67/thumbulator), transpiled to JS with
[emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/). Cycle-accurate PCM
audio is derives from work done by Chris Brenner. The favicon and homescreen icons
in Stellerator were taken from Stella.
